Bring some dry ice & make it look like your computer is smoking.
Log on, wait a sec, then get a frightened look on your face and scream "Oh no!! They've found me!" and bolt.
Laugh uncontrollably for about 3 minutes & then suddenly stop and look suspiciously at everyone who looks at you.
Type frantically, often stopping to look at the person next to you evilly.
Before anyone else is in the lab, connect each computer to different screen than the one it's set up with.
Work normally for a while. Suddenly look amazingly startled by something on the screen and crawl underneath the desk.
Every time you press Return and there is processing time required, pray "Ohpleaseohpleaseohpleaseohplease," and scream "YES!" when it finishes.
Sit and stare at the screen, biting your nails noisely.  After doing this for a while, spit them out at the feet of the person next to you.
If you have long hair, take a typing break, look for split ends, cut them and deposit them on your neighbor's keyboard as you leave.
Come to the lab wearing several layers of socks.  Remove shoes and place them of top of the monitor.  Remove socks layer by layer and drape them around the monitor.  Exclaim sudden haiku about the aesthetic beauty of cotton on plastic.
Borrow someone else's keyboard by reaching over, saying "Excuse me, mind if I borrow this for a sec?", unplugging the keyboard & taking it.
Attempt to eat your computer's mouse.
